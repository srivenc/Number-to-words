# Number-to-words
Takes an integer and converts the integer into a word for every digit.
There are 3 methods one method that converts the number to words, one that reverses an integer, and one that gets the amount of digits in an integer. The goal of the program is to call the numberToWords method with a number and it returns a integer converted. For example, if you enter the integer "357", the method will print "Three", "Five", "Seven". It does not work with negative numbers however. Additionally, the negative check in the getDigitCount method is necessary for this exercise.
